				<!-- Hello! <br> <br>
				You want to start studying physics, geophysics, meteorology or teaching physics in Karlsruhe in the 2020/2021 winter semester? Then you are exactly right here! If not, you can find your O-phase under 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.asta-kit.de/o-phase"> www.asta-kit.de/o-phase. </a> <br><br>
				Regardless of this, you probably have a lot of questions: What lectures do I have to take? What is my schedule like? Which textbooks are recommended? How do I find the lecture halls, cafeteria, library, ...? Where are the best pubs in Karlsruhe? What else can you do at the university besides studying? <br>
				In order to make it easier for you to start your studies and to answer these questions, we organize an orientation phase for new students every winter semester. We would like to cordially invite you to the next O phase in the winter semester 2020/2021. It starts on Monday, October 26th, 2020 and ends on Friday, October 30th, 2020. <br><br>
				That begs the next question: Who are we actually? We are students ourselves who stand up for the interests of the students at the faculty. We also provide advice and information, such as this O-Phase, but also exam collections, examination protocols and much more. You can find out more about our work on our <a target="_blank" href="https://fachschaft.physik.kit.edu/drupal/"> website </a> or ... right: during the O-Phase . <br> <br>
				See you! <br>
				Your Greta and Alex <br> <br> -->
				

				<span class = "thick"> ATTENTION: Due to the entry into force of the third pandemic level in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, we had to completely restructure our O-Phase again. You will always find the latest information on this website. </span> <br> <br>
 
				Since the number of cases is also increasing rapidly in Karlsruhe, we unfortunately had to switch the O-Phase entirely to digital. We hope that you can still experience a nice O-Phase and make friends for your studies. For this we have thought about a few things how you can get to know fellow students in a playful way in a virtual environment. We wish you a nice and instructive O-Phase! <br>
				The O-Phase starts on <span class = "thick"> Monday, October 23rd. at 11:00 </span>. The organization team is currently in the high phase of planning and has already drawn up a preliminary schedule for you. <br> <br>
				Please download the programs <a href="https://zoom.us/download"> Zoom </a> and <a href = "https://discord.com/download"> Discord </a> which we will mainly use for presentations and communication. You can find more information about this in the <a href="<?= dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])?>/faq">FAQ</a>.
