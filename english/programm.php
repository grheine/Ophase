  <h3> Welcome </h3>
<h4> When: 11am - 12pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Zoom </h4>
<p> The O-Phase starts on Monday with the welcome at 11am in Zoom. As part of the welcome, we would like to officially and warmly welcome you to KIT and thus to university life. We are, on the one hand, the student council and, on the other, the dean and the dean of studies of the physics faculty. But who are we actually? We are students ourselves who stand up for the interests of the students at the faculty. We also provide advice and information, such as the O-Phase, but also exam collections, examination protocols and much more. You can find out more about our work on our <a target="_blank" href="https://fachschaft.physik.kit.edu/drupal/"> website </a> or ... right: during the O-Phase . You should have received the link to the welcome by email. If you have not received an email, first check your spam folder and otherwise let us know that you have not received an email so that we can help you. For this you can use, for example, the <a href="<?= dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])?>/kummerkasten"> contact form </a>. </p>

<h3> Group time </h3>
<h4> When: 12pm - 4pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Discord </h4>
<p> In group time you spend time with your O-Phase group. Based on the information you provided when registering, we assigned you to a suitable group. On the one hand, we made sure that you match your interests as well as aspects such as the course. During the group times, your tutors will tell you a lot about the course and may teach you a few tricks to make the course more enjoyable. During group time you will also have the opportunity to have lunch. You can easily arrange with your tutors and your group when the lunch break will take place. Originally it was planned to arrange the group times in presence. Unfortunately, we had to switch this to digital, as the number of infections has increased dramatically in the last few days. But no worry! You will also have enough opportunities to get to know your fellow students in the virtual environment. </p>

<h3> Rally </h3>
<h4> When: 4pm - 7pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Discord </h4>
<p> And there we come to the first opportunity to get to know your fellow students better: the rally - which admittedly this year is more of a quiz. But nonetheless: Here you have the opportunity to solve the tasks of the rally in groups of three and with a little luck, win great prizes. </p>

<h3> Games evening </h3>
<h4> When: 8pm - End </h4>
<h4> Where: Discord </h4>
<p> On the first evening we will organize a game night for you on the Discord Channel. Here the tutors provide different rooms for games like Among Us, LoL, Skribble and much more. We wish you a lot of fun! </p>

<div id="Tuesday" class="tabcontent">
  <br>
<h3> Group time </h3>
<h4> When: 11am - 3pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Discord </h4>
<p> Tuesday morning starts again with time with your group. Today your tutors have plenty of time to show you various websites for and about studying. The exact organization of the group time is of course dependent on your tutors. </p>

<h3> SCC presentation </h3>
<h4> When: 3pm - 3:30pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Zoom </h4>
<p> This year, the Steinbuch Center for Computing (SCC) is again offering an introduction to the services offered by the SCC during the O phase in order to give an insight into the IT offers of the KIT. Topics include the KIT account, tools for emptying online, the SCC's print service or how you can set up a VPN connection. </p>

<h3> Presentation of culture and university groups </h3>
<h4> When: 4pm - 6pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Zoom </h4>
<p> The KIT campus is culturally very diverse. There are, for example, over 70 cultural and university groups. There is still something for almost everyone to get involved in alongside their studies. With today's imagination, of course, only a fraction of these groups can imagine. We have focused on groups that are most relevant to physics students. Today, for example, you will get to know many physicists' favorite pub - Z10 - which is run entirely on a voluntary basis and is also a cultural center where concerts, theater evenings etc. are offered free of charge. Other groups that introduce themselves today are the student council itself, the jDPG, the Night of Science and many more. In any case, it is worthwhile to take a look outside the box and to collect skills away from the study desk. </p>

<h3> Physics theater performance stream </h3>
<h4> When: 8pm - End </h4>
<h4> Where: still open </h4>
<p> Tonight we are showing you the recordings of a past piece from the physics theater. We won't reveal which piece it will be yet, just let us surprise you. We can only tell you one thing: it will be fun and entertaining. </p>
</div>

<div id="Wednesday" class="tabcontent">
  <br>
  <h3> Examination regulations and minor subject presentation </h3>
<h4> When: 11am - 1pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Zoom </h4>
<p> Presentation of the examination regulations for the various courses of study (each in different rooms). For the physics Bachelor presentation, this presentation also includes an overview of the minor subjects. </p>

<h3> Group time </h3>
<h4> When: 1pm - 6pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Discord </h4>
<p> Today you are spending time with your group again. And for today we have come up with something very special, namely a campus tour via video stream. A few of the tutors make their way across the campus with livecam and tell you interesting and funny anecdotes about one or the other building or place on campus. </p>

<h3> Student council meeting </h3>
<h4> When: 6pm - 7pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Zoom </h4>
<p> Here you can experience a student council meeting live and find out what topics the student council deals with in order to make the life of the students at KIT a little better. </p>

<h3> Evening with the group </h3>
<h4> When: 8pm - End</h4>
<h4> Where: still open </h4>
<p> Today we left it free for your tutors to come up with your own program. So be curious what your tutors have come up with for your fun. </p>
</div>

<div id="Thursday" class="tabcontent">
 <br>

<h3> Group time </h3>
<h4> When: 11am - 3pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Discord </h4>
<p> Today you spend one last time with your group. </p>

<h3> Prof Café </h3>
<h4> When: 3pm - 5pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Zoom </h4>
<p> Now you have got to know your fellow students a little better, the professors are still missing. At the Prof Café you can get to know your future professors in a relaxed atmosphere. For this purpose, the Profs have filled in profiles that you can read through to get to know them a little better. You can also chat with the respective professionals in individual video chat rooms and ask them holes in their stomachs. </p>

<h3> Chatroulette </h3>
<h4> When: 8pm - End </h4>
<h4> Where: Discord </h4>
<p> In Discord Chat Roulette you can playfully get to know new fellow students from your semester. The principle is very simple: you will be randomly assigned to a conversation partner and then have the opportunity to chat. It's funniest, of course, when you turn on the camera and can see yours across the street. If you then want to have a new conversation partner, you can simply switch and be assigned to the next fellow student and so on and so forth. </p>

<div id="Friday" class="tabcontent">
<br>
<h3> Technical support </h3>
<h4> When: 11am - 1pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Zoom </h4>
<p> We approach the last day very relaxed. We have set up a consultation hour for technical support for this purpose. If, for example, your MS team is not yet working or you need other help setting up your PC for studying physics, you will get the right help here </p>

<h3> Institute presentations </h3>
<h4> When: 1pm - 5pm </h4>
<h4> Where: Zoom </h4>
<p> In order to give you an overview of the topics on which the Physics Institutes at KIT are researching, some of the institutes are introducing themselves today. For example, you can look forward to lectures on theoretical particle physics, quantum materials and technologies, meteorology and a few more. Of course, we can only show a fraction of the faculty's institutes here. So just have a look at the <a href="http://www.physik.kit.edu/Institute.php"> faculty page </a> to see which institutes there are at our faculty. </p>
